# RESPONSIBLE AI, A PATHWAY TO FAIRNESS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW

A B S T R A C T

Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises profound societal changes, but concurrently poses significant challenges concerning fairness and responsible use. This systematic literature review explores four dimensions of responsible AI and fairness: data, algorithms, governance, and human-centric approach. Recent research is interrogated to uncover the state of the art in identifying and mitigating unfairness in AI systems and explored the prevailing challenges and opportunities. Issues of bias in large-scale training datasets, definitions of fairness, and the opaque nature of AI models were highlighted. Strategies to tackle these issues include dataset documentation, causal conceptions of fairness, and explainable AI (XAI). The need for robust governance mechanisms, including effective regulations and policies, was also underscored. A notable "governance gap" is identified and argued for the imperative of a dynamic, adaptable approach to AI governance that can keep pace with AI advancements. A human-centered approach to AI development is stressed to AI development, emphasizing the importance of diverse perspectives - from technical experts to policymakers - in shaping equitable AI systems. This review serves as an essential step towards understanding the landscape of fairness in AI, revealing pressing areas for future research.
